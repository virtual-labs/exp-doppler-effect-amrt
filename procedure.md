## Procedure


<h3>Procedure:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Click the start button.</li>
  <li>Click on the drop-down combo box for selecting the medium.</li>
  <li>Select the detector direction and source direction from the drop-down combo box.</li>
  <li>Adjust the velocity of the source and observer using the slider.</li>
  <li>Adjust the frequency of the source using the slider.</li>
  <li>The detected frequency can be calculated using equation (1).</li>
  <li>The reset button resets all the default values.</li>
  <li>The user can perform the experiment with another set of values.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Lab Procedure:</h3>
<p>
  In this experiment, we learn how the apparent (observed) frequency of a sound changes with the velocities of the source and the observer. If both are stationary, the apparent frequency is the same as the emitted source frequency.
</p>
<p>
  When the source and observer move toward each other, the observer hears a higher frequency than the source frequency. When they move away from each other, the observer hears a lower frequency.
</p>
<p>
  In this experiment, we change the medium, the velocity of the source, the velocity of the observer, and the frequency of the source. For each case, we measure the detected (apparent) frequency.
</p>

<h3>Results:</h3>
<p>Source Frequency = ........................... Hz</p>
<p>Detected Frequency = ............................ Hz</p>
